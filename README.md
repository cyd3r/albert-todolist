# TODO list for the Albert launcher

This is a very basic TODO list for the Albert launcher. You can add, remove, and show todo entries.

## Installation

Clone this repsitory into the python modules folder:

    git clone https://github.com/cyd3r/albert-todolist ~/.local/share/albert/org.albert.extension.python/modules

## Usage

Once you've typed `todo` a list of all your entries will be showed. If you type more, only the entries that contain your search string will be shown. If you select one of them and press the enter key, the entry will be removed.

If you type some text after the `todo` keyword, you can add a new entry by selecting the row with the subtext *Create new entry*.

If you followed the installation instructions, the todo entries will be stored in `~/.local/share/albert/org.albert.extension.python/modules/todo/todo.txt`.
